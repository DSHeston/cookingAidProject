In the recipe-list component I'm trying to loop through my recipes array built in the recipe-list.ts. It's using a model built in the recipe.model.
I've checked for typos with no luck, I've tried putting randome text in the divs and they don't display. I know the file is properly connected because the button shows up on the page.
